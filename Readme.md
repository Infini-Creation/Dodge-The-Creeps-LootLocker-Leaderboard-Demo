This is the official _Godot_ 2D tutorial "**Dodge The Creeps**" game with _LootLocker_ _guest login_ feature and leaderboard integration.

It is not, by far, a comprenhensive tutorial on how to add _LootLocker_ features to your game, but more like the official demo, a working sample to take inspiration from.
It is neither the best way to use [_LootLocker_ SDK](https://github.com/ARez2/LootLocker-Godot-SDK) as it is still under heavy developpement and many things will change sooner or later.
